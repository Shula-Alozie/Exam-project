## Shulammite Repository App

To run the project, use:

### `npm start`

This project allows you to view and manage Shulammite's repositories with pagination. You can explore repository details such as:

- Creation date
- Description
- Default branch

---

I kept the content similar but made some minor adjustments for clarity and consistency.
